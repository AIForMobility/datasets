The purpose of this package is to be able to create a [VoTT](https://github.com/microsoft/VoTT) from a dataset after
inference using a trained model for object detection.

The main benefit of this is to be able to visualize the predictions using the software and correct the missing/wrong
predictions then export the new dataset and use it to train the model again and improve its performance.
